# gmusic.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gmusic-utils/gmusic.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gmusic-utils/gmusic.js)
Browser-side JS library for controlling [Google Music][].

[Google Music]: https://play.google.com/music/

This was built as part of [google-music-webkit][], a [node-webkit][] wrapper around [Google Music][]. It was forked from [radiant-player-mac@v1.3.1][], developed and created by [Sajid Anwar][] and [James Fator][] to make it reusable and well tested.

It is now being maintained by the teams of [GPMDP][] and [Radiant Player][]

`gmusic.js` is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Google Inc.

## Breaking changes in 6.0.0
* `playback.getPlaybackTime` renamed to `playback.getCurrentTime`
* `playback.setPlaybackTime` renamed to `playback.setCurrentTime`
* `playback.getSongInfo` renamed to `playback.getCurrentTrack`

## Breaking changes in 5.0.0
The method `toggleRepeat()` no longer accepts arguments and `setRepeat(mode)` has replaced its functionality.

## Breaking changes in 3.0.0
On Thursday May 14, 2015 Google launched a Material redesign of the site. This broke a lot of selectors/functionality. In 3.0.0, we updated our integration to handle those changes. The developer-facing interface has not changed but the underlying system was a breaking change so we decided to make it a major release.

## Getting Started
### npm
Install the module with: `npm install gmusic.js`

```js
// Load and initialize GMusic
var GMusic = require('gmusic.js');
window.gmusic = new GMusic(window);

// Access volume
window.gmusic.volume.getVolume(); // 50 (ranges from 0 to 100)
```

### bower
Install the module with: `bower install gmusic.js`

Once installed, add it to your HTML and access it via `window.GMusic`.

```html
<script src="bower_components/gmusic.js/dist/gmusic.min.js"></script>
<script>
  window.gmusic = new window.GMusic(window); // Our Google Music API
</script>
```

### Vanilla
If you are not using a package manager, download the latest script at:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmusic-utils/gmusic.js/master/dist/gmusic.min.js

Then, add it to your HTML and access it via `window.GMusic`.

```html
<script src="gmusic.min.js"></script>
<script>
  window.gmusic = new window.GMusic(); // Our Google Music API
</script>
```

## Documentation
`gmusic.js` exposes a constructor, `GMusic` as its `module.exports` (`window.GMusic` for `bower`/vanilla).

### `new GMusic()`
Constructor for a new Google Music API

### Volume
`gmusic.volume` exposes interfaces to the volume controls of Google Music. Volume can range from 0 to 100 in steps of 5 (e.g. 10, 15, 20).

- amount `Number` - Optional number to raise volume by
    - For example, if volume is 50 and amount is 5, then the volume will change to 55
    - If we exceed 100 when adding new values, volume will stop at 100
    - By default, this is 5

#### `volume.decreaseVolume(amount)`
Lower the volume by an amount

- amount `Number` - Optional number to lower volume by
    - For example, if volume is 50 and amount is 5, then the volume will change to 45

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint via `npm run lint` and test via `npm test`.

### Testing
Currently, we require a personal Google account exclusively for testing. We will be rating tracks, changing repeat settings, and need predictable track titles. We are using the following tracks (at least 3 required):

> Credentials: musopen@mt2014.com / password

https://musopen.org/music/1333/wolfgang-amadeus-mozart/the-marriage-of-figaro-k-492/

> Music cannot be uploaded via webdriver instance nor incognito window
>
> If you don't want to contaminate your personal account, create a new user profile in Chrome.

For exactly one track, set the following via "Edit Info" in Google Music:

```
Name:
this-is-a-name

Artist:
this-is-an-artist

Album Artist:
this-is-an-album-artist

Album:
this-is-an-album

Composer:
this-is-a-composer

Genre:
this-is-a-genre

Year:
2000

Track #:
1 of 10

Disc #:
3 of 5

Explicit:
Unchecked
```

Once your Google account is registered and the music is uploaded, set the following environment variables

Once your Google account is registered and the music is uploaded, we are ready to run our test suite:

```bash
# Set up Google Music credentials as environment variables
export GOOGLE_MUSIC_JS_EMAIL="your.google@account.email"
export GOOGLE_MUSIC_JS_PASSWORD="your-google-account-password"
# If you are on Windows, use the following
# set GOOGLE_MUSIC_JS_EMAIL="your.google@account.email"
# set GOOGLE_MUSIC_JS_PASSWORD="your-google-account-password"

# Install Selenium server files
npm run webdriver-manager-update

# Start up a Selenium server
npm run webdriver-manager-start &

# Run our tests
npm test
# If you are on Windows, please use
# npm run test-windows
```

##### Attribution
We have an automatic build setup on Travis CI that will run every day to catch changes made by Google as quick as possible. These tests make use of BrowserStack's services to remotely run Selenium tests, huge thanks to [BrowserStack][] for the support of Open Source projects like this one!

[BrowserStack]: https://www.browserstack.com/

##### Nightlies
Nightly builds are triggered on Travis CI by a third party service service [Nightli.es][]

[Nightli.es]: http://nightli.es/

#### Debugging
Finnicky tests can be debugged by a few methods

- Use `describe.only` and `it.only` to limit test suite to only run 1 at a time
- Use the following script to control

```
# Enter into the node REPL
node

// Prevent node from exiting via anything but an interrupt
process.exit = function () {};

// Emulate mocha being invoked normally
process.argv = ['node', '_mocha', '--timeout', '10000'];
require('mocha/bin/_mocha');

// Our test suite has written `global.browser` as the last Selenium session
global.browser;
browser;
```
